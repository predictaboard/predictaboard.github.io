# Website overview

The website serves as a leaderboard and project page for the PredictaBoard paper. It allows to sort LLM-assessor pairs according to PVR at various thresholds. By following the steps below, the leaderboards can be updated using up-to-date results present in the [project's repo](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/PredictaBoard). 

## How to update the website with new results
Notice that this has to be manually done every time new results are added to the [project's repo](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/PredictaBoard), as this is not updated automatically.

- Run `build.py`. This fetches the last results from the [project's repo](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/PredictaBoard), processes them, and generates the leaderboards starting from the templates (this requires the `jinjia` python package)
- Commit and push the updated `index.html` and the `json` files in `static/data`

## How to modify the website

The `templates` folder contains the template of the base page and uses `jinjia` to add the two leaderboards. The leaderboards are also generated by a template in the same folder. Thus, if you want to modify the webpage (eg changing the text), you must modify the template, then run `build.py`. If you modify the `index.html` file in the root directory, the edits will be overwritten the next time `build.py` is called. Then it's better not to touch that file.

The javascript that handles the sorting and filtering of the leaderboards is in `static/js/leaderboardFilters.js`, so you should modify that (and `templates/leaderboard.html`) if you want to add new features. Similarly, the style of the leaderboard is defined in `static/css/components.css` (and to a minor extent in `static/css/index.css`).

## Next steps 

In the future, we can add assessor-only/LLM-only results or a way to obtain the ARC for each LLM-assessor pair. 

# Academic Project Page Template
This is an academic paper project page template.


Example project pages built using this template are:
- https://horwitz.ai/probex
- https://vision.huji.ac.il/probegen
- https://horwitz.ai/mother
- https://horwitz.ai/spectral_detuning
- https://vision.huji.ac.il/ladeda
- https://vision.huji.ac.il/dsire
- https://horwitz.ai/podd
- https://dreamix-video-editing.github.io
- https://horwitz.ai/conffusion
- https://horwitz.ai/3d_ads/
- https://vision.huji.ac.il/ssrl_ad
- https://vision.huji.ac.il/deepsim



## Start using the template
To start using the template click on `Use this Template`.

The template uses html for controlling the content and css for controlling the style. 
To edit the websites contents edit the `index.html` file. It contains different HTML "building blocks", use whichever ones you need and comment out the rest.  

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to replace the `favicon.ico` under `static/images/` with one of your own, otherwise your favicon is going to be a dreambooth image of me.

## Components
- Teaser video
- Images Carousel
- Youtube embedding
- Video Carousel
- PDF Poster
- Bibtex citation

## Tips:
- The `index.html` file contains comments instructing you what to replace, you should follow these comments.
- The `meta` tags in the `index.html` file are used to provide metadata about your paper 
(e.g. helping search engine index the website, showing a preview image when sharing the website, etc.)
- The resolution of images and videos can usually be around 1920-2048, there rarely a need for better resolution that take longer to load. 
- All the images and videos you use should be compressed to allow for fast loading of the website (and thus better indexing by search engines). For images, you can use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com), for videos you can need to find the tradeoff between size and quality.
- When using large video files (larger than 10MB), it's better to use youtube for hosting the video as serving the video from the website can take time.
- Using a tracker can help you analyze the traffic and see where users came from. [statcounter](https://statcounter.com) is a free, easy to use tracker that takes under 5 minutes to set up. 
- This project page can also be made into a github pages website.
- Replace the favicon to one of your choosing (the default one is of the Hebrew University). 
- Suggestions, improvements and comments are welcome, simply open an issue or contact me. You can find my contact information at [https://horwitz.ai](https://horwitz.ai)
